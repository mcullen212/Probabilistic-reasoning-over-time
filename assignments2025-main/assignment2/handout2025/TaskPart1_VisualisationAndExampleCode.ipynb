Prepare yourself to answer the following question in your report: “What is the actual observable difference in the two sensor/observation models, and how does this difference affect the localisation with forward filtering in different settings?”. Inspect and later discuss / explain especially the \"no reading\" visualisation of the two observation models (also called sensor)! You should base this discussion on your own inspection of the viewer, i.e. by visualising the different observation (sensor) models (“0”, non-uniform failure, and “1”, uniform failure) in the GUI cell, but of course you can also consult the explanations given in the document DetailedInstructionsAndBackground.\n",
